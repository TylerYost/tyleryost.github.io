        class="flex rounded-full h-64 w-64 bg-contain mx-auto md:float-right my-6 md:ml-10">

    <p>With over 16 years of experience, I am a strategic and collaborative product director specializing in digital transformation and enterprise-scale programs. I am a proven leader with a track record of building and scaling global teams and aligning stakeholders to drive innovation and long-term value. My expertise spans industries, and I have consistently delivered significant results, from increasing revenue to improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>I create value:</strong> I led the development and launch of a multi-product sales and onboarding platform that drove business growth and customer satisfaction. This initiative increased new product sales by 5% per month, accelerated revenue growth across multiple business lines, and reduced manual processing time by over 50,000 hours annually, freeing up resources for higher-value work. I also spearheaded the development of a high-impact platform to deliver "next generation" business value to our customers. I'm metrics driven and customer obsessed which I have used to halve customer churn and double customer lifetime value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>I build teams:</strong> I have a consistent record of building and leading high-performing organizations. I built and led a 100+ person cross-functional team, including nine people managers. I launched a career pathing and talent development initiative to transition non-product staff into product roles, strengthening internal capability and engagement. I'm also recognized for my exceptional leadership and team development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>I navigate complexity:</strong> I thrive in complex and complicated environments. I successfully navigated complex stakeholder environments, aligning business, legal, risk, compliance, and technology teams under a shared strategic vision. I led "Project Polaris," the company‚Äôs largest digital platform to date, integrating more than 60 disparate systems to deliver unified performance. Additionally, I oversaw a strategic cost initiative that helped a large financial institution achieve $1 billion in vendor leverage savings during a major merger.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Strengths: How I Lead and Develop My Team</h2>

    <p>My approach to product leadership is guided by my top 5 strengths, which I use to not only drive business outcomes but also to empower and develop the people around me.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Command:</strong> While I'm comfortable taking charge, my real strength is in building clarity and trust. I can navigate difficult conversations and align diverse stakeholders, which gives my team the confidence to move forward. This frees them up to focus on their work, knowing that I'm clearing a path for them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> I am driven to make a meaningful impact, and I help my team find their own sense of purpose. I ensure their work is visible and that their accomplishments are recognized. By connecting their daily tasks to the broader business goals, I help them see how their unique contributions are essential to our collective success.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Futuristic:</strong> I am inspired by what the future holds. This strength allows me to paint a vivid picture of what we are building and why it matters. By sharing a compelling vision, I inspire my team to rally behind a shared purpose and innovate for what's next.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Strategic:</strong> I have a knack for seeing patterns in complexity. I help my teams cut through the noise by defining a clear, actionable path forward. By playing out different scenarios and anticipating obstacles, I empower them to make well-informed decisions and focus on the work that matters most.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Activator:</strong> I am the spark that turns ideas into action. I help my teams overcome "analysis paralysis" by setting a decisive pace and creating a bias for action. This enables us to learn by doing and quickly launch new products and features, which builds momentum and confidence.</p>
        </li>
       
        
        
    </ul>
